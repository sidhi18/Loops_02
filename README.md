# 🚀 Day 2 – Java Loops Practice (For Loop)

This file contains simple Java programs using **for loops** to practice iteration concepts.  

---

## ✅ Programs Covered

1. **Even Numbers from 1 to 20
   ```java
   for (int i = 0; i <= 20; i++) {
       System.out.println(2*i);
   }

2. Odd Numbers from 1 to 20
    
 for (int i = 1; i <= 20; i++) {

    System.out.println(2*i+1);
   
}
3. Reverse Counting from 10 to 0

for (int i = 10; i >= 0; i--) {

    System.out.println(i);
}
4.Sum of Even Numbers from 1 to 100

int sum = 0;

for (int i = 1; i <= 50; i++) {

   int even = 2*i;
   
   sum = sum + even;
}

System.out.println("Sum of even numbers from 1 to 10 is: " + sum);


🎯 Key Learnings
Using for loop with different increments (i++, i+=2, i--).

Printing sequences (even, odd, reverse).

Performing calculations inside a loop (sum of numbers).

Reinforced loop fundamentals for iteration and logic building.

📌 Next Step
👉 Add Factorial Program using loops in the next practice.

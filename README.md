# ðŸš€ Day 2 â€“ Java Loops Practice (For Loop)

This file contains simple Java programs using **for loops** to practice iteration concepts.  

---

## âœ… Programs Covered

1. **Even Numbers from 0 to 10**
   ```java
   for (int i = 0; i <= 10; i += 2) {
       System.out.println(i);
   }

2. Odd Numbers from 1 to 10
    
 for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i += 2) {

    System.out.println(i);
   
}
3. Reverse Counting from 10 to 0

for (int i = 10; i >= 0; i--) {

    System.out.println(i);
}
4.Sum of Even Numbers from 1 to 10

int sum = 0;

for (int i = 2; i <= 10; i += 2) {

    sum += i;
}

System.out.println("Sum of even numbers from 1 to 10 is: " + sum);


ðŸŽ¯ Key Learnings
Using for loop with different increments (i++, i+=2, i--).

Printing sequences (even, odd, reverse).

Performing calculations inside a loop (sum of numbers).

Reinforced loop fundamentals for iteration and logic building.

ðŸ“Œ Next Step
ðŸ‘‰ Add Factorial Program using loops in the next practice.
